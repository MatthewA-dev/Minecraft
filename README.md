# Minecraft
It's minecraft, I think.

# Setup
Due to some limitations to how I wanted to do textures, you must include the textures folder in the same root as the compiled jar. 
Other than that, launch the project using the build.gradle, run other:dist to compile, and run the jar file with the textures folder to play this.
Alternatively, you can run other:run to just run it.
